Assignment 1
1.13 Suppose that a spherical droplet of liquid evaporates at a rate that is proportional to its surface area. dVdt=−kA where V=volume (mm3), t=time (min), k=the evaporation rate(mm/min), and A=surface area (mm2). Use Euler’s method to compute the volume of the droplet from t=0 to 10 min using a step size of 0.25 min. Assume that k=0.08 mm/min and that the droplet initially has a radius of 2.5 mm. Assess the validity of your results by determining the radius of your final computed volume and verifying that it is consistent with the evaporation rate. 

    Send me the plot V=V(t) and your code implementing Euler algorithm.
    Explain what will happen with the droplet at t>10 min.
    Obtain analytical solution and compare it with the numerical one.

Assignment (c) is optional, but I will give extra point if it is done correctly. 

```{r Assignment_1}

step <- 0.25
k <- 0.08
r0 <- 2.5

x <- seq(t0,tf,by=step)



drop_data <- data.frame(x)
dependent_variables <- c("vol_euler","vol_analytical")
drop_data[,dependent_variables] <- NA
drop_data[1,dependent_variables] <- (4/3 * pi * r0^3)

for (i in 2:nrow(drop_data)){
  drop_data[i,"vol_euler"] <- (drop_data[1,"vol_euler"] - (k * drop_data[i,'x'] * 4 * pi * r0^2))  
  drop_data[i,"vol_analytical"] <- (4/3 * pi * (r0-(k*drop_data[i,'x']))^3)
}

Assignment 11
Homework on Monte Carlo algorithm
Consider a single atom, which has the potential energy E(x)=kcx2, where x is atom’s
coordinate and kc=0.1 is a constant. Develop a Monte Carlo (MC) program, which
computes the average energy <E> of this atom at the temperatures T from 0.1 to 1.0 with
the increment of 0.1. For simplicity assume that kB=1. Set maximum position
displacement during MC move to dx=10. Also, set at each temperature the initial
coordinate value x to 100.
If MC code works correctly, then <E> ≈ T/2. The deviation of <E> from the theoretical
result T/2 should not exceed 10%. Present the results as a plot <E> vs T and as a table.
Include in the table the number of MC steps performed to obtain <E> at each T. I also
need to see your code.
Optional assignment for extra credit: Compute the acceptance rate at each temperature
and investigate its dependence on temperature.
